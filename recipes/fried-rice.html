  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not completely cook the rice in one go as they will be cooked properly in steps further.</li>
    <li>Adding the sauces after adding vegetables can spoil their colour and texture. Refrain from doing so. </li>
    <li>Toss the pan as much as possible while cooking instead of using a ladle. This will prevent the rice from breaking.</li>
  </ul>
